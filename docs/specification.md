# Introduction

The IIR Study Exchange Format (ISEF) is a specification for the exchange of parts of or complete IIR Studies. In particular it focuses on those aspects that gather self-reported responses from study participants.

It defines both the core data-types to be used and generic instances for some of these data-types.

# Conventions

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

# Core and Optional

The ISEF is split into core and optional parts. Conforming implementations MUST implement all core parts of the specification and MAY implement all optional parts. Conforming implementations MUST be able to interoperate with other implementations that do or do not implement the optional parts.
