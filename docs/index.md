The IIR Study Exchange Format (ISEF) is a specification for the exchange of parts of or complete IIR Studies. In particular it focuses on those aspects that gather self-reported responses from study participants. You can find the [latest specification here](specification/).

The specification is still in an early stage of development and we encourage IIR researchers to contribute by creating comments or discussions through our [Github issues](https://github.com/biirrr/isef/issues) or by creating [pull requests](https://github.com/biirrr/isef) with specific changes.
